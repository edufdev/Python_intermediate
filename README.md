# Python_intermediate
I strengthened my skills to become a professional with Python, one of the most used languages in the world in backend development, data science and artificial intelligence. I learned concepts and practiced with challenges that will raise my programming level.

- Using list and dictionary comprehensions, and high order functions.
- Setting up a virtual environment with pip.
- Managing text files with the context manager.
- Learning what errors mean and how to handle them.
